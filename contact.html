                The Henderson High School Drama Department is committed to fostering a vibrant and 
                inclusive arts community. We encourage open communication and welcome inquiries from 
                students, parents, and the wider community. Among those who help with the drama department, 
                the first and foremost is our Head of Department, Mrs. Tucker. Her email is listed below 
                along with the school's main office contact information. We look forward to hearing from 
                you and hope to see you at our department.<br><br><br>
